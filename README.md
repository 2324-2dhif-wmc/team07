Augmented Reality (Handy) Schnitzeljagd in der Schule

We’re making a scavenger hunt using augment reality. You should go through the school finding 3d figures using your phone. The figures will give you a clue where the next 3d figure is located. You will be given questions based on our school, which you must answer correctly to proceed.  For a little help we’re providing an arrow which will you point you to the right location.
We’re making a website, using html,  where you use your camera for a scavenger hunt, which we’re programming using java script.
